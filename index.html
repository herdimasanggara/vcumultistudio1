  <h3>Multi-Studio I<br>Graphic Design 380<br>
    anggarah@vcu.edu<br>
    Monday and Wednesday<br>02:00 PM - 05:20 PM</h3>
  <div class="dropdown">
    <div class="accordion">Overview</div>
    <div class="accordionDrop">
      <p>This studio emphasizes critical engagement, research, and speculation. Students engage in collaboration, peer learning, and interdependent discovery.<br><br>
        This course brings together students from the Sophomore and Junior levels of the program, with Seniors enrolled in the GDES 480 class. The goal behind this course is to create a less fragmented and more holistic learning experience.<br><br>
        Projects in this course follow a non-hierarchical teaching model where the structure and content is corroboratively developed. The focus is on producing design actions that develop out of a thorough and comprehensive research model coupled with an awareness of the impact and implications of resulting design outcomes.

              ⨂ Class overview.<br>
              ⨂ Bring one item that represents you.<br>
              ⨂ In an 8.5 by 11 inches file, using only Photoshop tools and limited to two colors, draw an interpretation of that object. You can only use your mouse/mousepad (using drawing stylus is forbidden). <i>Avoid making a photorealistic line drawing of the object through tracing.</i> Instead, try to draw them based on your own aesthetic sensibility and try to incorporate Photoshop effects into the drawing. Aim for unexpected discovery of Photoshop's tools, because the less you know about Photoshop, the better the outcome. After you finish with them, export them as .png or .jpg. In addition, please write a 15 word description of the item and send them to my email along with the drawing interpretation attached.<br>
              ⨂ The writing doesn't need to be dry and descriptive. It could be elusive, poetic, or even comedic.<br>

            <div class="left">
              ⨂ I'll project your drawing interpretations to the screen. When your work shows up, please read the 15 word description that you had written to the class.<br>
              ⨂ For the first project that will be assigned by the seniors next week, the class will be divided into 5 groups of 3 and 3 groups of 2. I'll leave this to you all to decide who are you working with. Either number has its own advantage. In groups of 3, you will have more people to brainstorm, but it means you have to come into agreement longer. In groups of 2, you will make decisions faster, but it means you have less manpower. Think about what sort of environment that suits you better. Each group will be advised by one senior and each group needs to have at least one junior and one sophomore.<br>
              ⨂ After you team up, start interviewing with each other. These are questions that you can ask to start the conversations going: What are you currently watching? Do you break traffic rules if you do not see a cop around? Do you think magic is real? Do you have a party trick? Do aliens exist? What's the most reckless thing you've ever done? If you could be granted 3 wishes, what would they be? (Of course you can ask questions beyond these.) Decide one image that represents the group and compose a creative writing that describes the group. Send the image to my email at the end of today by the latest.<br><br>
              ⨀ On Wednesday, the representation of the group (or the group as a whole) will perform the writing (while the chosen image is being projected on the screen).

            <p><strong>Attendance</strong></p>
            <div class="left">
              The departmental faculty have drafted a revised attendance policy, carefully considering the challenges and realities of holding classes in different spaces and in fractured time frames.<br><br>
              The standard VCU attendance policy states that student absences during the semester are not expected to exceed the number of times the class meets in one week. Our department has adopted a revised policy that addresses larger issues of
              expected engagement in a course. Consistent engagement is a vital component of successful completion of course objectives. The progression of this course requires all participants to be present and actively engaged in class, both during
              synchronous on-screen meetings, in person, and with asynchronous activities. Consistency of engagement is vital for successful completion of the course objectives. Each of us carries different circumstances and capacities; we are
              accountable for our own agency. This is always true, but especially crucial now. We are a community.<br><br>

              Be present for this class; participate consistently in the regular give-and-take of the classroom environment; be willing to share thoughts and experiences, as well as willing to actively listen to the thoughts and experiences of
              others.<br><br>

              Asynchronous engagement is equally important for your success in this course. If at any point during the semester you are unable to be present, communicate this clearly with me in a timely manner. Think about the manners in which you
              feel you will be able to be fully present and active with your community—this may differ from how others respond.<br><br>

              This class operates on the principle of charity, respect, and good faith. The responsibility to uphold and bolster these principles falls equally on all members of the class. Active listening is as important as active participation,
              please be gracious and generous with both. Connecting with peers is encouraged but does not substitute for communicating with the instructor directly. Contact me as soon as possible prior to, or after you miss a class. It is your
              responsibility to make-up for missing work.

            <p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>

            <div class="left">You will receive ongoing feedback on your work in group critiques and individual critiques with me. Projects and performance in this course will be evaluated with respect to three primary dimensions:<br><br>

              ⨁ <u>Participation:</u> your overall conduct throughout the duration of the project as you engage with the project and with your peers. Attendance, meeting deadlines, and being prepared for class will also be accounted for.<br>

              ⨁ <u>Process:</u> strength of your personal methodology and practice; idea generation and exploration; self evaluation; overall rigor in your approach to the project; articulation and presentation of your work; criticality.<br>

              ⨁ <u>Execution:</u> the quality of your ideas; craft; clarity of organization and presentation, how your materials (paper choice, imagery, typography, etc) connect to your concept.
