          This studio emphasizes critical engagement, research, and speculation.
          Students engage in collaboration, peer learning, and interdependent
          discovery.<br /><br />
          This course brings together students from the sophomore and junior
          levels of the program, with seniors enrolled in the GDES 480 class.
          The goal behind this course is to create a less fragmented and more
          holistic learning experience.<br /><br />
          Projects in this course follow a non-hierarchical teaching model where
          the structure and content is corroboratively developed. The focus is
          on producing design actions that develop out of a thorough and
          comprehensive research model coupled with an awareness of the impact
          and implications of resulting design outcomes.

                ⨂ Class overview.<br />
                ⨂ Bring one item that represents you.<br />
                ⨂ In an 8.5 by 11 inches file, using only Photoshop tools and
                limited to two colors, draw an interpretation of that object.
                You can only use your mouse/mousepad (using drawing stylus is
                forbidden).
                <i
                  >Avoid making a photorealistic line drawing of the object
                  through tracing.</i
                >
                Instead, try to draw them based on your own aesthetic
                sensibility and try to incorporate Photoshop effects into the
                drawing. Aim for unexpected discovery of Photoshop's tools,
                because the less you know about Photoshop, the better the
                outcome. After you finish with them, export them as .png or
                .jpg. In addition, please write a 15 word description of the
                item and send them to my email along with the drawing
                interpretation attached.<br />
                ⨂ The writing doesn't need to be dry and descriptive. It could
                be elusive, poetic, or even comedic.<br />

                ⨂ I'll project your drawing interpretations to the screen. When
                your work shows up, please read the 15 word description that you
                had written to the class.<br />
                ⨂ For the first project that will be assigned by the seniors
                next week, the class will be divided into 3 groups of 3 and 6
                groups of 2. I'll leave this to you all to decide who are you
                working with. Either number has its own advantage. In groups of
                3, you will have more people to brainstorm, but it means you
                have to come into agreement longer. In groups of 2, you will
                make decisions faster, but it means you have less manpower.
                Think about what sort of environment that suits you better. Each
                group will be advised by a group of seniors from Multi-Studio II
                and each group needs to have at least one junior and one
                sophomore.<br />
                ⨂ After you team up, start interviewing with each other. These
                are questions that you can ask to start the conversations going:
                What are you currently watching? Do you break traffic rules if
                you do not see a cop around? Do you think magic is real? Do you
                have a party trick? Do aliens exist? What's the most reckless
                thing you've ever done? If you could be granted 3 wishes, what
                would they be? (Of course you can ask questions beyond these.)
                Decide one image that represents the group and compose a
                creative writing that describes the group. Send the image to my
                email with the creative writing at the end of today by the
                latest.<br />
                ⨂ Examples of a collection of creative writing:
                <a href="https://taper.badquar.to/">Taper</a> & <a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net/"
                  >McSweeney's Internet Tendency</a
                >. <br /><br />
                ⨀ On Wednesday, the representation of the group (or the group as
                a whole) will perform the writing (while the chosen image is
                being projected on the screen).

                context of a specific location. Consider the different meanings
                and connotations of the words as you activate a specific spot in
                Pollak Bldg. Think about places that were often overlooked.
                Stairwells, hallways, elevator, the gaps between the tiles, etc.
                Discuss what place that you want to activate with your group and

                ⨂ Provide at least 5 examples of the artist(s)'s works in your
                group's presentation. Read what the artist(s) says about the
                work on their site, look for artist talk videos where they might

This part talks about a technique of cultural subversion-called detournement-that involves taking existing images, texts, or other cultural artifacts and repurposing them for a new, subversive message. Since our collective exhibition is about reinventing the spaces by creating some sort of interventions on the 3rd floor, the reading might be good to develop your ideas further.<br>

                    ⨂ Summary of the prompts in the collective exhibition:<br>
                    ⨠ The work must respond to some kind of input from the audience. This could be anything from a physical action, such as pressing a button or pulling a lever or opening a door, to an input on a digital device, such as clicking a mouse or tapping a screen.<br>
                    ⨠ The passersby are able to opt out the interactive elements to bypass the work. This means that the passersby are not being forced to interact with the works.<br>
                    ⨠ The work must be off the ground and it wouldn't obstruct the pathway of passersby.<br>
                    ⨠ The work must be able to make the audience to feel a sense of misdirection and there's an element of (harmless) risk while interacting with it.<br>
                    ⨂ <mark>Create a proposal for your work in the forms of wikiHow (e.g. <a href="https://www.wikihow.life/Write-Satire-About-Current-Events" target="_blank">How to Write Satire About Current Events</a>). You need to make 5 images (they don't need to be good) with captions indicating a) the concept of the work, b) how are you going to make the work, and c) how the passersby should interact with the works. Put those 5 images and their captions in Google Slides and send me the link by Monday, March 27th noon at the latest.</mark>

                    ⨂ Bad statement: "I am an artist who conjures up visual compositions through a clash of color and form. My work is a narration of my surroundings and is a culmination of my intuition and emotions. I aim to construct an illusion of harmony through a juxtaposition of contrasting shapes and shades. I am continuously in pursuit of originality, innovation and I want my art to kindle a passion for innovation and inquiry. Through my work, I want to transport my patrons to a world that is unfamiliar and distinct from what they know. My art is a portal to a distinct reality, and I want my patrons to imbibe this world with all of its quirks and intricacies." It doesn't say anything. It used highfalutin languages to disguise the lack of descriptive statements in the writing.<br>
                    ⨂ Read more about this in this Triple Canopy essay by Alix Rule and David Levine, <a href="https://canopycanopycanopy.com/contents/international_art_english" target="_blank">"International Art English"</a>. They examine the use of jargon and academic language in the contemporary art world and they argue that this language serves to obscure rather than clarify meaning, and contributes to a culture of exclusivity within the art world.<br>

              <p><strong>Attendance</strong></p>
              <div class="left">
                The departmental faculty have drafted a revised attendance
                policy, carefully considering the challenges and realities of
                holding classes in different spaces and in fractured time
                frames.<br /><br />
                The standard VCU attendance policy states that student absences
                during the semester are not expected to exceed the number of
                times the class meets in one week. Our department has adopted a
                revised policy that addresses larger issues of expected
                engagement in a course. Consistent engagement is a vital
                component of successful completion of course objectives. The
                progression of this course requires all participants to be
                present and actively engaged in class, both during synchronous
                on-screen meetings, in person, and with asynchronous activities.
                Consistency of engagement is vital for successful completion of
                the course objectives. Each of us carries different
                circumstances and capacities; we are accountable for our own
                agency. This is always true, but especially crucial now. We are
                a community.<br /><br />

                Be present for this class; participate consistently in the
                regular give-and-take of the classroom environment; be willing
                to share thoughts and experiences, as well as willing to
                actively listen to the thoughts and experiences of others.<br /><br />

                Asynchronous engagement is equally important for your success in
                this course. If at any point during the semester you are unable
                to be present, communicate this clearly with me in a timely
                manner. Think about the manners in which you feel you will be
                able to be fully present and active with your community—this may
                differ from how others respond.<br /><br />

                This class operates on the principle of charity, respect, and
                good faith. The responsibility to uphold and bolster these
                principles falls equally on all members of the class. Active
                listening is as important as active participation, please be
                gracious and generous with both. Connecting with peers is
                encouraged but does not substitute for communicating with the
                instructor directly. Contact me as soon as possible prior to, or
                after you miss a class. It is your responsibility to make-up for
                missing work.

                performance in this course will be evaluated with respect to
                three primary dimensions:<br /><br />

                ⨁ <u>Participation:</u> your overall conduct throughout the
                duration of the project as you engage with the project and with
                your peers. Attendance, meeting deadlines, and being prepared
                for class will also be accounted for.<br />

                ⨁ <u>Process:</u> strength of your personal methodology and
                practice; idea generation and exploration; self evaluation;
                overall rigor in your approach to the project; articulation and
                presentation of your work; criticality.<br />

                ⨁ <u>Execution:</u> the quality of your ideas; craft; clarity of
                organization and presentation, how your materials (paper choice,
                imagery, typography, etc) connect to your concept. <br /><br />
